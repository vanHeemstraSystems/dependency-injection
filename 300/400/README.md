# 400 - Tsyringe

One of the most popular design patterns in object-oriented programming is the Dependency Injection (DI) pattern. It allows for decoupling of components and promotes better testability and flexibility. However, the traditional way of implementing DI can sometimes lead to a lot of boilerplate code and increase complexity. This is where “Tsyringe” comes in, a lightweight and powerful DI container for TypeScript and JavaScript. In this article, we will explore the advantages of Tsyringe over the ordinary Dependency Injection pattern and how it can make your code simpler, more readable, and easier to maintain.

Tsyringe is a popular dependency injection library for TypeScript that provides some advantages over the traditional way of implementing dependency injection in JavaScript or TypeScript. Some of the advantages of Tsyringe include:

## Type safety
Tsyringe provides type safety by using TypeScript’s type system to ensure that dependencies are properly injected and resolved.

## Automatic dependency injection
Tsyringe can automatically inject dependencies for you without requiring manual configuration.

## Support for decorators
Tsyringe supports decorators, which makes it easy to annotate classes and functions with metadata that can be used for dependency injection.

## Support for singleton and scoped instances
Tsyringe supports creating singleton and scoped instances, which can improve performance and reduce memory usage.

Let’s look at an example of how Tsyringe can be used to implement dependency injection:

```
import { injectable, inject, container } from 'tsyringe';

interface ILogger {
  log(message: string): void;
}
@injectable()
class ConsoleLogger implements ILogger {
  log(message: string): void {
    console.log(message);
  }
}
@injectable()
class UserService {
  constructor(@inject("logger") private logger: ILogger) {}
  public registerUser(name: string, email: string, password: string): void {
    // Register user logic...
    this.logger.log(`User ${name} registered successfully`);
  }
}
container.register<ILogger>("logger", { useClass: ConsoleLogger });
const userService = container.resolve<UserService>(UserService);
userService.registerUser("John", "john@example.com", "password");
```
